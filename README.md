Public School's Accessibility to Green Space 

Research has proven there are significant physical and mental health benefits associated with use of quality greenspaces. Vegetation improves air quality, reduces noise, and mitigates urban temperatures. Furthermore, having easy and quick access to green spaces encourages more movement and physical activity which is crucial for combating possible chronic diseases. Green spaces also have a significant correlation to stress reduction, happiness and improved mood, and cognitive benefits such as improved concentration and memory. The fresh air and claming effects of parks and gardens provides a mental reset and promotes productivity. There are many social benefits to having parks and gardens nearby, because they provide a gathering space for the community and encourage social interaction.

Public schools benefit tremendously from being closeby to a park, or a large green area. The aforementioned physical, mental, and social benefits are a necessity in childhood development and parks are valuable spaces for students; not only can these parks be used as an outdoor space for recreaion and physical exercise, but they also can be used for environemntal education. Accordingly, I have chosen to create a map showing parks and green spaces in the City of Vancouver and how many public schools have comfortable access to this space. 

This map is designed to be used by parents and school teachers to view which parks are accessible to them and use the map for navigation purposes. Hence the parks being the only areas highlighted with green, and road networks being more visible and prominent. The location of all public schools in the City of Vancouver were retrieved from 'City of Vancouver Open Data Portal' and allows the users to visualize the proximity of schools to green spaces. Schools can use this map to locate which parks are within walking distance for a fieldtrip, and parents can use this map to aid in their school enrollment decision-making. This map can also be used by schoolboard or regional planners as a basemap to analyze ideal locations for future schools. I was also able to add interactivity in the form of pop-ups. I assumed this would be useful for the audience (i.e. parents) to select a school symbol and get the name and address of that school, and be able to zoom in and see the roads allowing access to that school or park. 

My map can be further improved by adding additional layers depicting census information--such as population density to analyze the ratio of residents and accessible green space, or income disparity to analyze whether there is a lack of quality green space for lower income neighbourhoods.
